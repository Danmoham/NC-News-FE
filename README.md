# Nc News FE Project

This project has been designed to emulate a real world news website, this has been created using react js and you can view the deployed website here: https://dans-ncnews.netlify.app/. You can also view the github repo here: github.com/Danmoham/NC-News-FE. We used our back end API that we created on the attached link : https://github.com/Danmoham/NC-News, which fetched data from a database that we present to you and manipulate with this front end application. 

If you wish to clone this project please follow the below: 
1. Git clone github.com/Danmoham/NC-News-FE
